Flexbox:-
 -->The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and      aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.
-->To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: flex;

Grid:-
-->CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.

-->To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.

Choosing between Flexbox and Css Grid depends on our specific requirements of layout:

---we choose Flexbox when we need to arrange items along a single axis, for example, when creating navigation bars, header/footer layouts, or aligning elements within a container.

---we choose CSS Grid when we need to create complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It's particularly useful when we have a grid-like structure, such as galleries, forms with multiple fields, or any design that requires precise control over both rows and columns.
